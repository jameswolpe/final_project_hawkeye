# Notes on Coding

## Serves
Direction: 4 = out wide, 5 = body, and 6 = down the T.

## Rally Sequence
f = forehand
b = backhand

r = forehand slice (including defensive chips, but not drop shots)
s = backhand slice (including defensive chips, but not drop shots)

## Direction
1 = to a right-hander's forehand side
2 = down the middle of the court (middle 40% of the court)
3 = to a right-hander's backhand side

## Exceptions (For now deleting if any occur)
### Serves
+ is used for serve and volley
* is used for ace serves
# is used for unreturnable serves (same as forced error)
@ is used for unforced errors
0 is used on serve if the location is not known
c is used for let serves

### Rally sequence
v = forehand volley
z = backhand volley
(see below for an optional additional code to indicate a stop volley/drop volley)

o = standard overhead/smash
p = "backhand" overhead/smash

u = forehand drop shot
y = backhand drop shot

l = forehand lob
m = backhand lob

h = forehand half-volley
i = backhand half-volley

j = forehand swinging volley
k = backhand swinging volley

t = all trick shots, including behind-the-back, between-the-legs, and "tweeners."

q = any unknown shot

### Direction
0 = unknown direction
