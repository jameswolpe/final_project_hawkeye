Clara is working with brewery data and making a shiny app with a leaflet where you can select a city and view its brewery, as well as a page where you can view the ABV and IBU of a selected beer. She needs to add titles to the graph and decide if she wants to do a second selection for the IBU, ABV graph.

Patrick is working on a project with Mario cart data. Making a shiny apps using the starts of the car wheels and gliders, where you can select one of each and view the combined stats. A problem he has is the names of some of the variables are not correct and he will probably have to manually rename them.
