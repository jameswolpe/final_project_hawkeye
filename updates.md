Found data on historical backgammon data if i want to use it to make a
shinyapp. 
Did research if a machine learning could actually beat the sportsbooks for different sports.

## March 23 begining of class
Decided on working with tennis  and found two data sets for it. One small data set that makes some hayk-eye data available (found on github from a CrowdANALYTIX competition) and a crowd sourced data set that logs tennis matches. The goal will be to analize forced and unforced errors by analyzing if "Wardlaw directionals" work.
