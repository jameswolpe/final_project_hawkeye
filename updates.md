Found data on historical backgammon data if i want to use it to make a
shinyapp. 
Did research if a machine learning could actually beat the sportsbooks for different sports.

## March 23 begining of class
Decided on working with tennis  and found two data sets for it. One small data set that makes some hayk-eye data available (found on github from a CrowdANALYTIX competition) and a crowd sourced data set that logs tennis matches. The goal will be to analize forced and unforced errors by analyzing if "Wardlaw directionals" work.

## March 23 end of class
Spent much of class figuring out setting up git on my new computer. Once completed I read some work from (https://github.com/Laurae2/Laurae) and began to decide how to classify directional shots. Realized I need a category to classify shot quality based on speed and topspin.

## March 28 begining of class
Read "pressure tennis" and met with my coach on ways to classify directionals, decided to work with crowd souced data, and found a new data set of a Nadal, Djokovic match.

## March 28 end of class
Loaded in the data and began taking notes on how it was classified, added to a plot I found online to include directional lines in red.

## March 30
In my note book drew out all possible point combinations and wrote out their codes, discovered this will be a little more complicated as I will need to look at 3 consecutive shots in a sequence rather than just two (except on the ultimate shot and the serve) to know where the player of interest was located when the penultimate shot of interest comes.
